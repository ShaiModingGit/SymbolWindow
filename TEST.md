    - Use `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` to navigate items.
    - Verify the selection moves up and down.
    - Press `Enter` to jump to the selected symbol.
- [ ] **Sync Selection (Editor to List)** (Planned - Not Implemented)
    - Click on a symbol (e.g., function name) in the active editor.
    - Verify the corresponding item in the Symbol Window list is automatically selected and scrolled into view.

## 3. Current Symbol Window (Mode: Current)
- [ ] **Default State**
    - Open a file (e.g., `.c`, `.cpp`, `.ts`).
    - Verify all symbols in the file are displayed in a tree structure.
- [ ] **Readiness State**
    - Open a large C/C++ project (or simulate slow extension activation).
    - Verify the view shows a "Waiting for language server..." or similar loading state initially.
    - Verify it automatically updates to show symbols once the language server is ready.
- [ ] **Context Switching**
    - Switch between two open files.
    - Verify the list updates immediately to show symbols for the newly active file.
- [ ] **Search/Filtering**
    - Type in the search bar.
    - Verify the list is filtered in real-time (Client-side filtering).
    - Verify parent nodes expand if a child matches the query.
    - Verify clearing the search bar restores the full list.
- [ ] **Empty State**
    - Close all editors.
    - Verify the list is empty.
    - Verify no error messages are shown.
- [ ] **Consistency**
    - Perform the same search multiple times.
    - Verify the results are identical each time.

## 4. Project Symbol Window (Mode: Project - Normal Search)
- [ ] **Default State**
    - Switch to Project Mode.
    - Verify the list is initially empty (or shows a prompt to search).
- [ ] **Search Functionality**
    - Type a query (e.g., `main`, `Symbol`).
    - Verify results are fetched from the workspace.
    - Verify "No results found" is displayed if the query matches nothing.
- [ ] **Consistency**
    - Perform the same search multiple times.
    - Verify the results are identical each time.
- [ ] **Instant Search (Cache Verification)**
    - Type a query (e.g., "Controller") in Project Mode. Note the time it takes to appear (e.g., ~1 second).
    - Clear the search bar.
    - Type "Controller" again immediately.
    - Verify the results appear **instantly** (perceptibly faster than the first time), indicating efficient reuse of data.

## 5. Deep Search
- [ ] **Enable Deep Search**
    - Set `symbolWindow.enableDeepSearch` to `true`.
    - Switch to Project Mode.
    - Verify the "Toggle Search Details" (kebab menu) button appears in the search bar.

    - Enter a glob pattern (e.g., `*.ts`).
    - Perform a search.
    - Verify results only include `.ts` files.
    - Press `Esc` while focused on the input.
    - Verify the input is cleared.
- [ ] **State Persistence**
    - Set a Scope and Include Pattern.
    - Reload the window.
    - Verify Scope and Include Pattern are preserved.
    - Verify the Details panel open/closed state is preserved.
- [ ] **Cancel Deep Search**
    - Trigger a long-running Deep Search (e.g., common keyword in large repo).
    - Click the "Cancel" button.
    - Verify the search stops and the loading indicator disappears.
- [ ] **Results Display**
    - Verify Deep Search results have a distinct background highlight (to distinguish from standard results).
    - Verify Deep Search results are collapsed by default.
    - Verify hovering over a Deep Search result shows a tooltip "Result from Deep Search".
    - Verify results are relevant (contain the keyword).
- [ ] **Deduplication**

## 6. Database Mode (Performance & Indexing)
- [ ] **Enable Database Mode**
    - Set `symbolWindow.enableDatabaseMode` to `true` in settings.
    - Verify the view title changes to **PROJECT WORKSPACE (DATABASE)**.
- [ ] **Indexing Performance**
    - Trigger `Rebuild Symbol Index (Full)`.
    - Verify indexing completes reasonably fast (e.g., < 10s for small projects, < 1m for medium).
    - Verify the progress bar updates smoothly.
- [ ] **Incremental Updates**
    - Create a new file `test_symbol.ts` with a unique class `class TestUniqueSymbol {}`.
    - Save the file.
    - Search for `TestUniqueSymbol`.
    - Verify the new symbol appears in the results.
    - Delete the file.
    - Search for `TestUniqueSymbol`.
    - Verify the symbol is removed from the results.
- [ ] **Exclude Files**
    - Add `**/*.ts` to `symbolWindow.excludeFiles`.
    - Rebuild Index.
    - Verify no `.ts` symbols appear in search.
    - Remove the exclusion.
- [ ] **Include Files**
    - Set `symbolWindow.includeFiles` to `**/*.md`.
    - Rebuild Index.
    - Verify ONLY `.md` files are indexed (if they have symbols).
- [ ] **Persistence**
    - Index the workspace.
    - Reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window`).
    - Perform a search immediately.
    - Verify results are returned instantly without re-indexing.
- [ ] **Git Integration (Ignored Files)**
    - Create a file inside `node_modules` or a folder listed in `.gitignore`.
    - Verify symbols from this file are **not** indexed or searchable.

## 7. State Management & Synchronization
- [ ] **File Updates (Data Freshness)**
    - **Current Mode**:
        - Modify a symbol in the active file (e.g., rename a function) and **Save**.
        - Verify the name updates in the list immediately.
    - **Project Mode**:
        - Search for a symbol (e.g., `MyFunction`) and verify it appears.
        - Rename `MyFunction` to `MyFunctionNew` in the editor and **Save** the file.
        - Without clicking Refresh, search for `MyFunction` again.
        - Verify it returns **no results** (proving the old data was invalidated).
        - Search for `MyFunctionNew`.
        - Verify it is found immediately.
- [ ] **Readiness Feedback (Project Mode)**
    - Open the extension in a large workspace (or one where the language server is slow to start).
    - Verify the view shows a **Loading Indicator** with text "Waiting for symbol provider...".
    - Verify the search bar is disabled while loading.
    - Verify the UI automatically unlocks (search bar enabled, loading disappears) when ready.
- [ ] **Transition Flow**
    - **Empty to Active (Cold Start)**:
        - Start with no files open (Empty Workspace).
        - Verify the Symbol Window is empty and shows no loading spinner (UI is "Ready").
        - Open a file in a large project (where LSP takes time).
        - Verify the "Waiting for symbol provider..." loading state appears immediately.
        - Verify symbols load once the LSP is ready.
    - **Active to Active**:
        - Open File A. Verify status transitions to Ready and symbols load.
        - Open File B. Verify status remains Ready (no "Loading" flash) and symbols update.
- [ ] **Timeout & Retry Feedback**
    - If the extension stays in "Loading..." for too long (simulated timeout), verify a **"Timeout" or "Error" message** appears (e.g., red text).
    - Click the **Refresh Button**.
    - Verify the error message disappears, and the "Loading..." state reappears as it retries.
- [ ] **"Best Effort" Responsiveness**
    - Trigger a "Loading" or "Timeout" state in Project Mode (e.g., by opening a huge folder).
    - Switch to **Current Document Mode**.
    - Verify the list **immediately** populates with symbols for the active file, ignoring the Project Mode error/loading state.

## 8. Additional Considerations (Edge Cases)
- [ ] **Manual Refresh**
    - Perform a search and see results.
    - Click the **Refresh Button**.
    - Verify the view briefly flashes or shows a loading state, indicating that a fresh search is being performed against the workspace.
- [ ] **Pagination / Infinite Scroll** (Project Mode)
    - Search for a common term (e.g., `e`) that returns > 100 results.
    - Scroll to the bottom of the list.
    - Verify more results are loaded automatically.
- [ ] **Theme Compatibility**
    - Switch VS Code themes (Light, Dark, High Contrast).
    - Verify text is readable and selection highlights are visible.
- [ ] **Extension Activation**
    - Reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window`) with the view open.
    - Verify the extension activates and restores the previous mode/state correctly.

## 9. Configuration & Display
- [ ] **Clean C-Style Types** (`symbolWindow.cleanCStyleTypes`)
    - **Enabled (Default)**:
        - Create/Open a C/C++ file with a struct typedef: `typedef struct MyStruct { ... } MyStruct;`
        - Verify the symbol appears as `MyStruct` in the list.
        - Verify `(struct)` or `(typedef)` appears in gray text next to the name (Detail).
    - **Disabled**:
        - Go to Settings -> Symbol Window -> Uncheck "Clean CStyle Types".
        - Refresh the view.
        - Verify the symbol appears as `MyStruct (struct)` (or similar) in the main name text.
- [ ] **Move Function Signatures** (`symbolWindow.moveSignatureToDetail`)
    - **Enabled (Default)**:
        - Create/Open a file with a function: `void myFunction(int a, char b);`
        - Verify the symbol appears as `myFunction` in the list.
        - Verify `(int a, char b)` appears in gray text next to the name (Detail).
    - **Disabled**:
        - Go to Settings -> Symbol Window -> Uncheck "Move Signature To Detail".
        - Refresh the view.
        - Verify the symbol appears as `myFunction(int a, char b)` in the main name text.
- [ ] **Indexing Batch Size** (`symbolWindow.indexingBatchSize`)
    - **Default (15)**:
        - Trigger a full re-index (e.g., delete DB and reload).
        - Verify indexing proceeds in chunks (observe logs or progress bar).
    - **Max Limit (200)**:
        - Set `symbolWindow.indexingBatchSize` to `0` or `300`.
        - Trigger a full re-index.
        - Verify indexing proceeds in chunks of 200 (observe logs).

## 10. State Persistence & Stability
- [ ] **Atomic Save Handling**
    - (Requires external tool or script to simulate atomic save: write new -> rename -> delete old)
    - Modify a file externally using an editor that performs atomic saves (e.g., Vim, or some configurations of VS Code).
    - Verify no `ENOENT` errors appear in the "Extension Host" output channel.
    - Verify the index is updated correctly.
- [ ] **Empty File Handling**
    - Create a file `empty.c` with no symbols (just comments or whitespace).
    - Save the file.
    - Verify the indexer processes it without error.
    - Restart VS Code.
    - Verify the indexer does **not** re-index `empty.c` (it should have been recorded in the DB with 0 symbols).
- [ ] **UI State Persistence**
    - **Scenario**: Indexing in Progress.
        - Trigger a Full Rebuild.
        - While the progress bar is moving, run `Developer: Reload Window`.
        - **Verify**: The progress bar reappears and continues (or shows the correct state) after reload.
    - **Scenario**: Database Mode Label.
        - Ensure Database Mode is active (Title shows "PROJECT WORKSPACE (DATABASE)").
        - Switch to the "Source Control" view, then back to "Symbol Window".
        - **Verify**: The title still shows "PROJECT WORKSPACE (DATABASE)".
- [ ] **Rebuild Index Commands**
    - **Incremental**:
        - Modify a file outside of VS Code (or just save one).
        - Run `Symbol Window: Rebuild Symbol Index (Incremental)`.
        - **Verify**: It finishes quickly and updates the index.
    - **Full**:
        - Run `Symbol Window: Rebuild Symbol Index (Full)`.
        - **Verify**: The progress bar starts from 0% and goes to 100%. The database is cleared and repopulated.
